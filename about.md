Hey! I'm second year Computer Engineering undergraduate at the University of Guelph. I enjoy problem solving - CS or Mathematical - and computer hardware. Increasing efficiency of software or hardware is incredibly interesting to me, and as such, so is algorithmic analysis.

This site is a side project of mine - taking what I've done in for my degree/free time so far, and talking about it. It started as an attempt to make my code and thought processes presentable for a professional setting. It turned into a website. 

This is for archival and educational purposes (to improve my understanding, and hopefully someone else's!)

Feel free to contact me with questions/comments.
